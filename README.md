# Web-map-of-films-and-their-locations
This is a module for creating web art. The web map displays information about the places in which films were made depending on the year. The user specifies the year of the movie card which he wants to build and as a result he receives an HTML file with the map. The map consists of three layers: the locations of the films, the country in which the films were made and number of them and  third, the layer of the world map colored by population
